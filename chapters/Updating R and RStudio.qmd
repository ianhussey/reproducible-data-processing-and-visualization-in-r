## Updating R and RStudio

### Updating R and transferring packages

**Windows**: Windows users can install `installr` and type:

``` r
install.packages("installr")
library(installr)
updateR()
```

This will update R and a window will pop up to ask whether you want to transfer your installed packages to the new version.

**MacOS**: Mac users need to update manually:

-   Either using homebrew in the terminal by typing:

``` bash
brew update
brew upgrade r
```

-   or manually by going to CRAN and re-download R.

You can transfer your packages by finding them using

``` r
.libPaths()
```

and then looking for the library in your finder (e.g. \~/Library/R/4.3/library/) and copying all downloaded content to the new versionâ€™s library folder (e.g. \~/Library/R/4.4/library/).

### Updating RStudio 

Must always be updated manually in both Windows and MacOS by downloading the newest installer from [posit.co](https://posit.co/download/rstudio/).
