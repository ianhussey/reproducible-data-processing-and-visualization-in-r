## Create project skeleton

```{r}

library(psychdsish)
create_project_skeleton(project_root = "../")

```

Note that you could also do this from the console without this .qmd file, if you know your project's file path, e.g., `psychdsish::create_project_skeleton(project_root = "~/git/my_project")`.

## Delete project files and directories except '../tools/'

For testing.

WARNING: DELETES ALL FILES IN PARENT DIRECTORY OTHER THAN THE CURRENT FILE!

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: false

delete_project_skeleton(project_root = "../")

```
